Description: An R Package to infer lncRNA associated pathways from Large-scale 
             cancer transcriptome sequencing data by using two metrics to link 
             gene signatures with a lncRNA expression in tumor patient samples 
             from the TCGA study. It is capable of identifying enriched pathways
             regulated by lncRNAs in human cancers.
